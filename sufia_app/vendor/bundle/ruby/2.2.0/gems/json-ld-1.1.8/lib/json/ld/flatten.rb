    ##
    # This algorithm creates a JSON object node map holding an indexed representation of the graphs and nodes represented in the passed expanded document. All nodes that are not uniquely identified by an IRI get assigned a (new) blank node identifier. The resulting node map will have a member for every graph in the document whose value is another object with a member for every node represented in the document. The default graph is stored under the @default member, all other graphs are stored under their graph name.
